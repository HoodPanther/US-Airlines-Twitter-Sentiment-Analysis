# US-Airlines-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis


We analyze seven days of data from Twitter regarding customer sentiment for 6 US airlines: American, Delta, Southwest Airlines, United, US Airways, and Virgin America. From this data we evaluate how customer sentiment evolves over a week. We also evaluate how customers tweet sentiment by airline, and the efficiency that others retweet that sentiment. We find that for most airlines, more tweets are posted on Mondays and decrease over the rest of the week. In contrast, American recieves most tweets on Sundays and Mondays, and relatively few posted on other days. Additionally, we find that United receives the most negative tweets by far. Additionally, we find that the liklihood of a tweet being retweeted is dependent on the sentiment and airline. Negative tweets about United, American, and US Airways are more likely to be retweeted than positive tweets. In contrast, positive tweets about Southwest, Virgin America, and Delta are more likely to be retweeted than negetive tweets. We hypothesize that public opinion is driving this bias.
